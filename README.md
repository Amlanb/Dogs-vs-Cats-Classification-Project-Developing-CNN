# Dogs-vs-Cats-Classification

# Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to classify images of dogs and cats using the "dogs-vs-cats-mvml-2020" dataset from Kaggle. The model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning, employing the MobileNetV2 architecture for efficient and accurate image classification. The project encompasses data acquisition, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 25,000 images of dogs and cats.

  Training set: 18,752 images (9376 dogs, 9376 cats)
  Test set: 6,248 images

The dataset is balanced, with an equal number of dog and cat images in the training set. The images vary in size, requiring a resizing step.

# Data Acquisition
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.

!kaggle competitions download -c dogs-vs-cats-mvml-2020 -p "D:/Deep Learning Data/dogs-vs-cats" --force

# Data Extraction
The downloaded zip file was extracted using the zipfile library.

# import zipfile
# Define paths
dataset_folder = r"D:\Deep Learning Data\dogs-vs-cats"
zip_file = os.path.join(dataset_folder, "dogs-vs-cats-mvml-2020.zip")

# Extract the ZIP file if it exists
if os.path.exists(zip_file):
    print("Extracting dataset...")
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file, 'r') as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall(dataset_folder)
    print("Dataset extracted successfully!")
else:
    print("Error: Zip file not found!")

# Data Exploration
The data exploration phase included:

  Counting images in the training and test directories.
  Visualizing sample dog and cat images to confirm the loading and labeling process.
  Checking the class balance to ensure no bias during training.
  Determining the range of image sizes to inform the resizing strategy.

# Counting number of images in train data
folder_path = r"D:\Deep Learning Data\dogs-vs-cats\train"
image_count = len([f for f in os.listdir(folder_path) if f.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg'))])
print(f"Number of images: {image_count}")

# Displaying sample images
folder = r"D:\Deep Learning Data\dogs-vs-cats\train"
img = next(f for f in os.listdir(folder) if "dog" in f)
plt.imshow(Image.open(os.path.join(folder, img))), plt.show()

# Checking class balance
folder = r"D:\Deep Learning Data\dogs-vs-cats\train"
files = os.listdir(folder)
dogs = sum(1 for f in files if "dog" in f)
cats = sum(1 for f in files if "cat" in f)
print(f"Dogs: {dogs}, Cats: {cats}")

# Determining image size range
folder = r"D:\Deep Learning Data\dogs-vs-cats\train"
files = [os.path.join(folder, f) for f in os.listdir(folder) if f.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg'))]
sizes = [Image.open(f).size for f in files] # (width, height)
max_width, max_height = map(max, zip(*sizes))
min_width, min_height = map(min, zip(*sizes))
print(f"Max size: {max_width}x{max_height}, Min size: {min_width}x{min_height}")

# Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were applied to the images:

# Resizing
All images were resized to 224x224 pixels. This standardization was necessary to ensure consistent input dimensions for the neural network.

folder = r"D:\Deep Learning Data\dogs-vs-cats\train"
output_folder = r"D:\Deep Learning Data\dogs-vs-cats\train_resized" # Output folder for resized images
os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True) # Create output folder if not exists

for file in os.listdir(folder):
    if file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')):
        img = Image.open(os.path.join(folder, file))
        img_resized = img.resize((224, 224)) # Resize to 224x224
        img_resized.save(os.path.join(output_folder, file)) # Save resized image

print("Resizing complete. Images saved in:", output_folder)

# Labeling
Filenames were parsed to generate labels for each image, with dogs labeled as 1 and cats as 0.

# Define the folder path
folder = r"D:\Deep Learning Data\dogs-vs-cats\train_resized"

# Get filenames
filenames = os.listdir(folder)

# Create labels list
labels = []

# Loop through filenames and assign labels
for i in range(len(filenames)):  # Loop through all images
    file_name = filenames[i]
    label = file_name[:3]  # Extract first three characters to identify 'dog' or 'cat'
    if label == 'dog':
        labels.append(1)
    else:
        labels.append(0)

# Image Conversion and Normalization
The images were converted to NumPy arrays and normalized to the range $$0, 1] by dividing by 255.

# Initialize image list
images = []

# Loop through filenames and convert images to arrays
for file_name in filenames:
    if file_name.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')):
        img = Image.open(os.path.join(folder, file_name))
        img_array = np.array(img)  # Convert image to NumPy array
        images.append(img_array)

# Convert lists to NumPy arrays
X = np.array(images, dtype=np.uint8)
y = np.array(labels, dtype=np.int32)

# Normalize pixel values to range [0,1]
X_train_scaled = X_train / 255.0
X_test_scaled = X_test / 255.0

# Data Splitting
The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

# Splitting the data (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=2)

# Model Architecture
The model architecture utilizes transfer learning with MobileNetV2.

# Base Model
The pre-trained MobileNetV2 model from TensorFlow Hub was loaded, and its layers were frozen to retain pre-trained weights.

import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import numpy as np  # Ensure numpy is imported

# Load MobileNetV2 from TensorFlow Hub
mobilenet_model = 'https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4'

# Wrap in Lambda layer to resolve Sequential model issues
pretrained_model = tf.keras.layers.Lambda(
    lambda x: hub.KerasLayer(mobilenet_model, trainable=False)(x),
    input_shape=(224, 224, 3)
)

# Custom Layers
The following custom layers were added on top of the MobileNetV2 base:

  A dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
  A dropout layer with a rate of 0.3.
  An output layer with 2 neurons and softmax activation.

# Define the model
num_classes = 2

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    pretrained_model,
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Model Compilation
The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer, Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

# Compile the model
model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0005),
    loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(),
    metrics=['accuracy']
